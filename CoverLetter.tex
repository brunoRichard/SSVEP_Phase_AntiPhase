Dear Sir/Madam,

We are pleased to resubmit our revised manuscript, entitled \textit{Neural responses to binocular in-phase and anti-phase stimuli}, for consideration for publication in Vision Research.

The reviewers' comments were insightful and highly beneficial, and we have carefully addressed all points raised in the previous review. Our detailed, point-by-point response to the reviewers is included in a separate document.

The resubmission package includes:

The revised manuscript, with all modifications marked in red (SSVEP Phase AntiPhase RedRevisions.pdf).

A clean, editable version of the manuscript (.tex file).

A folder containing all figures.

Our detailed Response to Reviewers document.

We appreciate the time and effort invested by the reviewers and by your editorial team. We believe the revisions have significantly improved the manuscript, and we hope you will now find it suitable for publication in Vision Research.

Thank you for your consideration.



Sincerely,

Bruno Richard
