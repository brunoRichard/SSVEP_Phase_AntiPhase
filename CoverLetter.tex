Dear Dr Oru\c{c},

We are pleased to resubmit our revised manuscript, entitled \textit{Neural responses to binocular in-phase and anti-phase stimuli}, for consideration for publication in Vision Research.

We appreciate the time and effort invested by the reviewers and the editorial team. We found much of the feedback to be insightful and highly beneficial, and have carefully addressed those points to improve the manuscript. However, we feel it is necessary to bring a specific concern regarding Reviewer 2 to your attention. 

Reviewer 2 begins their assessment with the statement: "I'm not sure what exactly the SSVEP tells us about visual processing." Steady-State Visually Evoked Potentials are a well-established methodology in human vision that has proven valuable for understanding multiple aspects of visual processing and serves as the core methodological foundation of our experimental design. The reviewer's initial remark suggests a fundamental mismatch between the reviewer's area of expertise and the technical scope of our work. Consequently, a significant portion of their subsequent feedback demonstrates a misunderstanding of our data and the established procedures (e.g., the use of Signal-to-Noise ratios to compare responses across multiple frequencies). We have still provided a comprehensive, point-by-point response to all of Reviewer 2's comments in the accompanying document. We respectfully ask that you weigh the applicability of their critiques in this context when evaluating our revisions.

The resubmission package includes:
\begin{enumerate}[itemsep = 0pt, topsep=0pt]
	\item A revised manuscript, with all modifications marked in red 
	\item A revised manuscript without the modifications marked in red. 
	\item A clean, editable version of the manuscript (.tex file).
	\item All figures in this manuscript are in a PNG format.
	\item Our detailed Response to Reviewers in a Word document.
\end{enumerate}

We believe the revisions have significantly strengthened the paper, and we hope you will now find it suitable for publication in Vision Research. 
Sincerely,

Bruno Richard \& Daniel H. Baker
