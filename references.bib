	abstract = {Our ability to detect faint images is better with two eyes than with one, but how great is this improvement? A meta-analysis of 65 studies published across more than 5 decades shows definitively that psychophysical binocular summation (the ratio of binocular to monocular contrast sensitivity) is significantly greater than the canonical value of âˆš2. Several methodological factors were also found to affect summation estimates. Binocular summation was significantly affected by both the spatial and temporal frequency of the stimulus, and stimulus speed (the ratio of temporal to spatial frequency) systematically predicts summation levels, with slow speeds (high spatial and low temporal frequencies) producing the strongest summation. We furthermore show that empirical summation estimates are affected by the ratio of monocular sensitivities, which varies across individuals, and is abnormal in visual disorders such as amblyopia. A simple modeling framework is presented to interpret the results of summation experiments. In combination with the empirical results, this model suggests that there is no single value for binocular summation, but instead that summation ratios depend on methodological factors that influence the strength of a nonlinearity occurring early in the visual pathway, before binocular combination of signals. Best practice methodological guidelines are proposed for obtaining accurate estimates of neural summation in future studies, including those involving patient groups with impaired binocular vision.

	abstract = {Sensitivity to corrugations defined by binocular disparity differs as a function of the modulation frequency. Such functions have proved to be useful descriptive and analytical tools in the study of the mechanisms involved in disparity processing. Indeed, given certain assumptions, these sensitivity functions can be used to predict certain perceptual outcomes. Given their importance, it is surprising that there is no comprehensive data set of disparity sensitivity functions (DSF) for a range of observers over a broad range of spatial frequencies and orientations. Here we report DSFs for six observers over an eight octave range of sinusoidal corrugations in disparity (0.0125-3.2 cpd). Multi-cycle, low frequency surfaces were used to assess the degree to which the fall-off in sensitivity at low corrugation frequencies is attributable to the decreasing number of cycles displayed. The data was found to form a continuous function despite the different number of cycles displayed. We conclude that the fall off in sensitivity is due to the spatial interactions in disparity processing. We also determined DSFs for the same observers to both vertically and horizontally oriented sinusoidal disparity corrugations in order to characterise the extent of the stereoscopic anisotropy In general, the best thresholds for detecting vertically oriented disparity corrugations were higher (~4 arc sec) than for horizontally oriented corrugations (~2 arc sec). Moreover, the functions were shifted toward the high spatial frequency end of the spectrum. Copyright (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

@article{Delorme2004,
	abstract = {We have developed a toolbox and graphic user interface, EEGLAB, running under the crossplatform MATLAB environment (The Mathworks, Inc.) for processing collections of single-trial and/or averaged EEG data of any number of channels. Available functions include EEG data, channel and event information importing, data visualization (scrolling, scalp map and dipole model plotting, plus multi-trial ERP-image plots), preprocessing (including artifact rejection, filtering, epoch selection, and averaging), independent component analysis (ICA) and time/frequency decompositions including channel and component cross-coherence supported by bootstrap statistical methods based on data resampling. EEGLAB functions are organized into three layers. Top-layer functions allow users to interact with the data through the graphic interface without needing to use MATLAB syntax. Menu options allow users to tune the behavior of EEGLAB to available memory. Middle-layer functions allow users to customize data processing using command history and interactive 'pop' functions. Experienced MATLAB users can use EEGLAB data structures and stand-alone signal processing functions to write custom and/or batch analysis scripts. Extensive function help and tutorial information are included. A 'plug-in' facility allows easy incorporation of new EEG modules into the main menu. EEGLAB is freely available (http://www.sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab/) under the GNU public license for noncommercial use and open source development, together with sample data, user tutorial and extensive documentation. {\copyright} 2003 Elsevier B.V.

@article{Livingstone1996,
	abstract = {In normal human subjects, evoked potentials in response to depth reversing two-color dynamic random-dot stereograms disappeared or were greatly reduced at equiluminance, whereas responses to shifts between patterns that were correlated and anticorrelated (for the two eyes) were, for most subjects, actually larger at equiluminance than at non-equiluminance. Responses were only slightly diminished at equiluminance to similar texture-shifting patterns that were identical to the two eyes. These results suggest that a significant fraction of cells with input from both eyes can respond to correlation/anticorrelation shifts, yet are not involved in stereopsis. Also, binocular rivalry may gate the responses of these binocular-nonstereoscopic units.},

@article{Georgeson2016,
	abstract = {Our goal here is a more complete understanding of how information about luminance contrast is encoded and used by the binocular visual system. In two-interval forced-choice experiments we assessed observers' ability to discriminate changes in contrast that could be an increase or decrease of contrast in one or both eyes, or an increase in one eye coupled with a decrease in the other (termed IncDec). The base or pedestal contrasts were either in-phase or out-of-phase in the two eyes. The opposed changes in the IncDec condition did not cancel each other out, implying that along with binocular summation, information is also available from mechanisms that do not sum the two eyes' inputs. These might be monocular mechanisms. With a binocular pedestal, monocular increments of contrast were much easier to see than monocular decrements. These findings suggest that there are separate binocular (B) and monocular (L,R) channels, but only the largest of the three responses, max(L,B,R), is available to perception and decision. Results from contrast discrimination and contrast matching tasks were described very accurately by this model. Stimuli, data, and model responses can all be visualized in a common binocular contrast space, allowing a more direct comparison between models and data. Some results with out-of-phase pedestals were not accounted for by the max model of contrast coding, but were well explained by an extended model in which gratings of opposite polarity create the sensation of lustre. Observers can discriminate changes in lustre alongside changes in contrast.},

@article{Meese2006,
	abstract = {A fundamental problem for any visual system with binocular overlap is the combination of information from the two eyes. Electrophysiology shows that binocular integration of luminance contrast occurs early in visual cortex, but a specific systems architecture has not been established for human vision. Here, we address this by performing binocular summation and monocular, binocular, and dichoptic masking experiments for horizontal 1 cycle per degree test and masking gratings. These data reject three previously published proposals, each of which predict too little binocular summation and insufficient dichoptic facilitation. However, a simple development of one of the rejected models (the twin summation model) and a completely new model (the two-stage model) provide very good fits to the data. Two features common to both models are gently accelerating (almost linear) contrast transduction prior to binocular summation and suppressive ocular interactions that contribute to contrast gain control. With all model parameters fixed, both models correctly predict (1) systematic variation in psychometric slopes, (2) dichoptic contrast matching, and (3) high levels of binocular summation for various levels of binocular pedestal contrast. A review of evidence from elsewhere leads us to favor the two-stage model.},

	abstract = {A widely used model of simultaneous luminance pattern masking is based on mechanisms that sum inputs linearly and produce a response that is an S-shaped function of that sum. This model makes two predictions about masking: (1) Changing the masker spatial waveform will shift the threshold-versus-masker contrast function horizontally by a multiplicative constant. (2) Adding a second fixed-contrast masker will shift this function horizontally by an additive constant. Experimental tests do not support these predictions. The results can be explained by a new model that incorporates broadband divisive inhibition, consistent with physiology.},

@article{BakerMeeseSummers2007,
	abstract = {Visual mechanisms in primary visual cortex are suppressed by the superposition of gratings perpendicular to their preferred orientations. A clear picture of this process is needed to (i) inform functional architecture of image-processing models, (ii) identify the pathways available to support binocular rivalry, and (iii) generally advance our understanding of early vision. Here we use monoptic sine-wave gratings and cross-orientation masking (XOM) to reveal two cross-oriented suppressive pathways in humans, both of which occur before full binocular summation of signals. One is a within-eye (ipsiocular) pathway that is spatially broadband, immune to contrast adaptation and has a suppressive weight that tends to decrease with stimulus duration. The other pathway operates between the eyes (interocular), is spatially tuned, desensitizes with contrast adaptation and has a suppressive weight that increases with stimulus duration. When cross-oriented masks are presented to both eyes, masking is enhanced or diminished for conditions in which either ipsiocular or interocular pathways dominate masking, respectively. We propose that ipsiocular suppression precedes the influence of interocular suppression and tentatively associate the two effects with the lateral geniculate nucleus (or retina) and the visual cortex respectively. The interocular route is a good candidate for the initial pathway involved in binocular rivalry and predicts that interocular cross-orientation suppression should be found in cortical cells with predominantly ipsiocular drive.},

	abstract = {Binocular summation was evaluated for contrast detection and discrimination. Monocular and binocular forced-choice psychometric functions were measured for the detection of 0.5-c/deg sine-wave gratings presented alone (simple detection), or superimposed on identical background gratings (discrimination). The dependence of detectability d' on signal contrast C could be described by: d' = (C/C')n. C' is threshold contrast, and n is an index of the steepness of the psychometric function. n was near 2 for simple detection, near 1 for discrimination, and was approximately the same for monocular and binocular viewing. Monocular thresholds were about 1.5 times binocular thresholds for detection, but the ratio dropped for suprathreshold discrimination. These results reveal a dependence of binocular summation on background contrast. For simple detection, binocular detectabilities were at least twice monocular detectabilities . For contrast discrimination, the amount of binocular summation decreased. For a 25%-contrast background, there was little or no binocular summation. It is concluded that binocular contrast summation decreases as background contrast rises.},

This complex architecture poses difficulties for attempts to link perceptual phenomena to activity at a particular level of the system. This difficulty has been especially salient in studies of binocular rivalry alternations, where there is seemingly conflicting evidence for a locus in primary visual cortex or alternatively in higher cortical areas devoted to object perception. Here, I use a competitive neural model to demonstrate that the data require at least two hierarchic rivalry stages for their explanation. This model demonstrates that competitive inhibition in the first rivalry stage can be eliminated by using suitable stimulus dynamics, thereby revealing properties of a later stage, a result obtained with both spike-rate and conductance-based model neurons. This result provides a synthesis of competing rivalry theories and suggests that neural competition may be a general characteristic throughout the form-vision hierarchy.},

@article{Blake1989,
	abstract = {When the two eyes view discrepant monocular stimuli, stable single vision gives way to alternating periods of monocular dominance; this is the well-known but little understood phenomenon of binocular rivalry. This article develops a neural theory of binocular rivalry that treats the phenomenon as the default outcome when binocular correspondence cannot be established. The theory posits the existence of monocular and binocular neurons arrayed within a functional processing module, with monocular neurons playing a crucial role in signaling the stimulus conditions instigating rivalry and generating inhibitory signals to implement suppression. Suppression is conceived as a local process happening in parallel over the entire cortical representation of the binocular visual field. The strength of inhibition causing suppression is related to the size of the pool of monocular neurons innervated by the suppressed eye, and the duration of a suppression phase is attributed to the strength of excitation generated by the suppressed stimulus. The theory is compared with three other contemporary theories of binocular rivalry. The article closes with a discussion of some of the unresolved problems related to the theory.},

We limit our survey primarily to work on human stereopsis, binocular rivalry and binocular contrast summation, with discussion where relevant of single-unit neurophysiology and human brain imaging. We identify several key controversies that have stimulated important work on these problems. In the case of stereopsis those controversies include position vs. phase encoding of disparity, dependence of disparity limits on spatial scale, role of occlusion in binocular depth and surface perception, and motion in 3D. In the case of binocular rivalry, controversies include eye vs. stimulus rivalry, role of ``top-down'' influences on rivalry dynamics, and the interaction of binocular rivalry and stereopsis. Concerning binocular contrast summation, the essay focuses on two representative models that highlight the evolving complexity in this field of study.},

	abstract = {We studied the rules by which visual responses to luminous targets are combined across the two eyes. Previous work has found very different forms of binocular combination for targets defined by increments and by decrements of luminance, with decrement data implying a severe nonlinearity before binocular combination. We ask whether this difference is due to the luminance of the target, the luminance of the background, or the sign of the luminance excursion. We estimated the pre-binocular nonlinearity (power exponent) by fitting a computational model to ocular equibrightness matches. The severity of the nonlinearity had a monotonic dependence on the signed difference between target and background luminance. For dual targets, in which there was both a luminance increment and a luminance decrement (e.g. contrast), perception was governed largely by the decrement. The asymmetry in the nonlinearities derived from the subjective matching data made a clear prediction for visual performance: there should be more binocular summation for detecting luminance increments than for detecting luminance decrements. This prediction was confirmed by the results of a subsequent experiment. We discuss the relation between these results and luminance nonlinearities such as a logarithmic transform, as well as the involvement of contemporary model architectures of binocular vision.},

	abstract = {Previous contrast discrimination experiments have shown that luminance contrast is summed across ocular (T. S. Meese, M. A. Georgeson, & D. H. Baker, 2006) and spatial (T. S. Meese & R. J. Summers, 2007) dimensions at threshold and above. However, is this process sufficiently general to operate across the conjunction of eyes and space? Here we used a "Swiss cheese" stimulus where the blurred "holes" in sine-wave carriers were of equal area to the blurred target ("cheese") regions. The locations of the target regions in the monocular image pairs were interdigitated across eyes such that their binocular sum was a uniform grating. When pedestal contrasts were above threshold, the monocular neural images contained strong evidence that the high-contrast regions in the two eyes did not overlap. Nevertheless, sensitivity to dual contrast increments (i.e., to contrast increments in different locations in the two eyes) was a factor of approximately 1.7 greater than to single increments (i.e., increments in a single eye), comparable with conventional binocular summation. This provides evidence for a contiguous area summation process that operates at all contrasts and is influenced little, if at all, by eye of origin. A three-stage model of contrast gain control fitted the results and possessed the properties of ocularity invariance and area invariance owing to its cascade of normalization stages. The implications for a population code for pattern size are discussed.},

However, the present study suggests that inputs from two eyes are summed in different ways. Foley's model was revised to describe TvC functions for binocular, monocular and dichoptic masking. The revised model has the following two characteristics. First, the revised model receives two monocular inputs. Secondly, excitations and inhibitory signals are subjected to nonlinear transducer functions before and after summation of the monocular signals. A two-alternative forced-choice procedure was used to measure contrast thresholds for Gaussian windowed sine-wave gratings (target) in the presence of sine-wave gratings (masker). Thresholds were measured for 11 masker contrasts and the three masking conditions. It was shown that this revised model fitted the data reasonably well. The revised model indicates how monocular inputs are summed in contrast processing. (c) 2005 The Optical Society of Japan.},

@article{Simmons2005,
	abstract = {How is chromatic contrast combined binocularly? One index of binocularity is the binocular contrast summation ratio (BCSR), which is the improvement in contrast sensitivity with binocular rather than monocular presentation. Simmons and Kingdom (1998, Vision Research 38 1063-1071) noted that BCSRs with some red-green isoluminant stimuli were suggestive of full linear summation. This suggestion was investigated further in four subjects by measuring binocular and monocular contrast thresholds for the detection of 0.5 cycle deg(1) isoluminant (red-green) and isochromatic (yellow-black) Gabor patches. These Gabor patches had either vertically or horizontally oriented carrier gratings and were either dichoptically in phase (same coloured bars in binocular correspondence) or in dichoptic anti-phase (opposite coloured bars in binocular correspondence). Full linear summation would be indicated by BCSRs of 2 for the in-phase and close to 0 for the anti-phase conditions. Mean BCSRs at isoluminance were 1.93 and 0.90, respectively, for the in-phase and anti-phase stimuli with horizontal carriers, the former being consistent with full linear summation, but the latter not. Despite these results, BCSRs obtained with isoluminant and isochromatic stimuli under similar conditions were not statistically distinguishable from each other, although there was a tendency for summation at isoluminance with in-phase stimuli to be higher and anti-phase stimuli to be lower. These data fall short of demonstrating full linear summation of chromatic contrast between the eyes under all presentation conditions, but they do indicate that there are strong binocular interactions at red-green isoluminance, which are similar to, and possibly even stronger than, those obtained with luminance stimuli.},

	abstract = {The brain combines visual information from the two eyes and forms a coherent percept, even when inputs to the eyes are different. However, it is not clear how inputs from the two eyes are combined in visual cortex. We measured fMRI responses to single gratings presented monocularly, or pairs of gratings presented monocularly or dichoptically with several combinations of contrasts. Gratings had either the same orientation or orthogonal orientations (i.e., plaids). Observers performed a demanding task at fixation to minimize top-down modulation of the stimulus-evoked responses. Dichoptic presentation of compatible gratings (same orientation) evoked greater activity than monocular presentation of a single grating only when contrast was low (<10%). A model that assumes linear summation of activity from each eye failed to explain binocular responses at 10% contrast or higher. However, a model with binocular contrast normalization, such that activity from each eye reduced the gain for the other eye, fitted the results very well. Dichoptic presentation of orthogonal gratings evoked greater activity than monocular presentation of a single grating for all contrasts. However, activity evoked by dichoptic plaids was equal to that evoked by monocular plaids. Introducing an onset asynchrony (stimulating one eye 500 ms before the other, which under attentive vision results in flash suppression) had no impact on the results; the responses to dichoptic and monocular plaids were again equal. We conclude that when attention is diverted, inter-ocular suppression in V1 can be explained by a normalization model in which the mutual suppression between orthogonal orientations does not depend on the eye of origin, nor on the onset times, and cross-orientation suppression is weaker than inter-ocular (same orientation) suppression.},

	abstract = {In binocular combination, light images on the two retinas are combined to form a single "cyclopean" perceptual image, in contrast to binocular rivalry which occurs when the two eyes have incompatible ("rivalrous") inputs and only one eye;s stimulus is perceived. We propose a computational theory for binocular combination with two basic principles of interaction: in every spatial neighborhood, each eye (i) exerts gain control on the other eye's signal in proportion to the contrast energy of its own input and (ii) additionally exerts gain control on the other eye's gain control. For stimuli of ordinary contrast, when either eye is stimulated alone, the predicted cyclopean image is the same as when both eyes are stimulated equally, coinciding with an easily observed property of natural vision. The gain-control theory is contrast dependent: Very low-contrast stimuli to the left- and right-eye add linearly to form the predicted cyclopean image. The intrinsic nonlinearity manifests itself only as contrast increases. To test the theory more precisely, a horizontal sine wave grating of 0.68 cycles per degree is presented to each eye. The gratings differ in contrast and phase. The predicted (and perceived) cyclopean grating also is a sine wave; its apparent phase indicates the relative contribution of the two eyes to the cyclopean image. For 48 measured combinations of phase and contrast, the theory with only one estimated parameter accounts for 95% of the variance of the data. Therefore, a simple, robust, physiologically plausible gain-control theory accurately describes an early stage of binocular combination.},

@article{DingKleinLevi2013,
	abstract = {We investigated suprathreshold binocular combination, measuring both the perceived phase and perceived contrast of a cyclopean sine wave. We used a paradigm adapted from Ding and Sperling (2006, 2007) to measure the perceived phase by indicating the apparent location (phase) of the dark trough in the horizontal cyclopean sine wave relative to a black horizontal reference line, and we used the same stimuli to measure perceived contrast by matching the binocular combined contrast to a standard contrast presented to one eye. We found that under normal viewing conditions (high contrast and long stimulus duration), perceived contrast is constant, independent of the interocular contrast ratio and the interocular phase difference, while the perceived phase shifts smoothly from one eye to the other eye depending on the contrast ratios. However, at low contrasts and short stimulus durations, binocular combination is more linear and contrast summation is phase-dependent. To account for phase-dependent contrast summation, we incorporated a fusion remapping mechanism into our model, using disparity energy to shift the monocular phases towards the cyclopean phase in order to align the two eyes' images through motor/sensory fusion. The Ding-Sperling model with motor/sensory fusion mechanism gives a reasonable account of the phase dependence of binocular contrast combination and can account for either the perceived phase or the perceived contrast of a cyclopean sine wave separately; however it requires different model parameters for the two. However, when fit to both phase and contrast data simultaneously, the Ding-Sperling model fails. Incorporating interocular gain enhancement into the model results in a significant improvement in fitting both phase and contrast data simultaneously, successfully accounting for both linear summation at low contrast energy and strong nonlinearity at high contrast energy.},

	abstract = {A number of the well-known visual after-effects of adaptation exhibit interocular transfer, so that presentation of an adaptation figure to one eye produces a temporary change in the performance of the nonadapted eye. This outcome is usually attributed to the involvement of binocular visual neurons that respond to stimulation of either eye. The fact that interocular transfer is incomplete (i.e., the transferred aftereffect is smaller in magnitude than that induced and measured in the same eye) is routinely cited as evidence for the involvement of monocular neurons. This article critically examines these two interpretations, which are developed in terms of a neural model of interocular transfer. No evidence, logical or empirical, was obtained for rejecting the model. Our analysis further shows that the model must assume some type of pooling process that operates over all tested neurons, both adapted and unadapted. Finally, general implications of the interocular transfer model are discussed, the aim being to delimit the conclusions that may be drawn from interocular transfer experiments.},

There are five distinct viewing conditions under which such 'after-effects' may be generated. There are MON-MON (inspect with one eye, same eye), BIN-BIN (inspect with both eyes, test both eyes), BIN-MON (inspect with both eyes, test only one eye), MON-BIN (inspect with one eye, test with both) and TRANSFER (inpect with one eye, test with the other eye). A model based upon the assumption of the linearly additive effects of adaptation generated in 'dominance classes' or cortical units that are driven either by one eye, or the other eye, or by either or both eyes together, is described. This model generates predictions concerning the expected ralative magnitudes of after-effects generated under the five viewing modes described above, and experiments are described that confirm these predictions. The model can be extended to gaenerate predictions about other experimental conditions. A more complex version of the model is consistent with electrophysiologically derived estimates of the proportion of cortical units in each dominance class.},

Here, it is argued that there are some discrepancies in the data between some of those studies and that one possible explanation for the discrepancies may be related to differences in methodology (e.g., stimuli presented to the fovea as opposed to the parafovea). We sought to resolve some of the discrepancies with two psychophysical paradigms involving alpha discrimination with visual noise and natural scene image patches presented to the fovea or parafovea. Fovea-parafovea threshold differences were apparent for stimuli possessing alpha values < 1.0, with the parafovea typically showing highest thresholds for reference alpha values in the 0.74-0.85 range. Both fovea and parafovea thresholds were lowest in the 1.2-1.4 range. In addition, we conducted a local amplitude distribution analysis (i.e., assessed local alpha) with a large set of high-resolution natural scene imagery and found that the results of that analysis provided a better account of the alpha discrimination thresholds for stimuli presented to the fovea as opposed to the parafovea.},

We have measured the ability of human observers to discriminate changes in these statistics using different natural and synthetic stimulus images and have found that the dependence of their discrimination thresholds upon the reference second-order statistics is similar in form, for both kinds of stimuli. However, there is some variety in the magnitudes of the thresholds for the natural stimulus images; in fact, the second-order statistics of different natural images are more diverse than previously suggested. The discrimination task can be modelled as the discrimination of changes in local contrast within restricted spatial frequency bands and is similar to the discrimination of blur.},

@article{WadeBaker2025,
	abstract = {Contrast is the currency of the early visual system. Measuring the way that the computations underlying contrast processing depend on factors such as spatial and temporal frequency, age, clinical conditions, eccentricity, chromaticity and the presence of other stimuli has been a focus of vision science for over a century. One of the most productive experimental approaches in this field has been the use of the `steady-state visually-evoked potential' (SSVEP): a technique where contrast modulating inputs are `frequency tagged' (presented at well-defined frequencies and phases) and the electrical signals that they generate in the brain are analyzed in the temporal frequency domain. SSVEPs have several advantages over conventional measures of visually-evoked responses: they have relatively unambiguous ouput measures, a high signal to noise ratio (SNR), and they allow us to analyze interactions between stimulus components using a convenient mathematical framework. Here we describe how SSVEPs have been used to study visual contrast over the past 70 years. Because our thinking about SSVEPs is well-described by simple mathematical models, we embed code that illustrates key steps in the modelling and analysis. This paper can therefore be used both as a review of the use of SSVEP in measuring human contrast processing, and as an interactive learning aid.},

The same logarithmic function described the results when a grating was simply flashed on and off; therefore, the apparent movement accompanying the phase alternations is not necessary to evoke the potential.3. The contrast at which the evoked potential reached the theoretically zero voltage (C(0)) was compared with the psychophysical contrast threshold, determined by means of proportion-of-time seen measurements; the C(0) contrast corresponded to 50% time seen.4. The potential, corrected for the proportion-of-time seen, was found linearly related to contrast.},
